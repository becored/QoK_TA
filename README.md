## How to play
Patch "QoK_TimeAttack_v1.0.ips" to a vanilla Ki no Bouken (The Quest of Ki) rom.  

## Features  
- Round Select (debug mode) is enabled.  
- Timer counts up instead of count-down and the finish time will be shown on the result screen.  
\* first number is seconds (0-255), second number is frames (0-60).  
\* no time up death due to this change, however original timer still runs in game (timer's color changes when time is up).  
- During pause, pressing SELECT will restart the current floor.  
- During pause, holding SELECT will send back to Round Select.  
- During Ki's death motion, pressing START/SELECT will restart the current floor quickly.  
- In the screen before starting the floor, pressing START/SELECT will start the floor quickly.
- Automatically skips the namco logo, Ishtar screen, and Quox screen.  
- Infinite lives
